## 🎯 Why We Built This

As BCA students ourselves, we experienced the frustration firsthand — previous year question papers were **scattered, hard to find, and unavailable** exactly when we needed them most.

We built PYQ Portal to change that. A clean, fast, and permanently free archive — so that every junior student at Marian College has one less thing to worry about before exams.

> *"We believe every student deserves access to quality study resources — without barriers, without cost."*
